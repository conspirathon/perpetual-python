### TRY IT YOURSELF: Chapter 7

#### 7-1. Rental Car:

Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they would like. Print a message about that car, such as "Let me see if I can find you a Subaru."

#### 7-2. Restaurant Seating:

Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they'll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

#### 7-3. Multiples of Ten:

Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of 10 or not.

#### 7-4. Pizza Toppings:

Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying you'll add that topping to their pizza.

#### 7-5. Movie Tickets:

A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person's age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

#### 7-6. Three Exits:

Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or 7-5 that do each of the following at least once:

- Use a conditional test in the <small>while</small> statement to stop the loop.
- Use an <small>active</small> variable to control how long the loops runs.
- Use a <small>break</small> statement to exit the loop when the user enters a <small>'quit'</small> value.

#### 7-7. Infinity:

Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press CTRL-C.)
