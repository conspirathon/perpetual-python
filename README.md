# python-crash-course

I'm creating this repository to work on my python fundamentals using the book:
'Python Crash Course' _third edition_ by: Eric Matthes

My goal is to solidfy my knowledege of python, so I can build solo projects more
confidently.

By using github to store this project, I am able to work on being more fluid with git and markdown at
the same time.

### chapters

I'm skipping the first two chapters.

1. I already have my environment set up
2. I don't need a file with: `print("Hello, world!)`

### organization

This might be messy, I'm _learning_ as I go.
